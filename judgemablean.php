			  <p><img src="images/JudgeMablean.jpg" width="297" height="391" alt="JudgeMablean" align="right" style="border: 2px solid #714241; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;">Mablean Ephriam was born to Robert and Mable Ephriam in Hazlehurst, Mississippi. She is no stranger to 
			  achievement.  Through hard, consistent and dedicated work, she strives to perform and do her God-given best.  
			  Since a child, she has always had that "spirit" of excellence and liberality about her.  The ninth of ten 
			  children, you could always find her somewhere reading, studying, and asking countless questions that could 
			  drive you crazy.  When she wasn't doing that, she could be found fighting for the rights of strangers and 
			  family members.  Her strong thirst for knowledge, equality and unselfishness parlayed into a rewarding, 
			  challenging, sometime agonizing and exhausting career in the practice of Family Law.</p>
  <p>
Twenty-five years ago, Judge Ephriam was admitted to the California Bar and in 1992 she was admitted to the United 
States Supreme Court.  At the age of 13 years, she knew she wanted to become a lawyer.  She set a plan in motion 
and went to work - allowing no obstacles to defeat or dissuade her.  She worked her way through the system, 
beginning in law enforcement for the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a Correctional Officer in the Women's 
Prison at Terminal Island.  From there, she became skillful in preparing documents for civil litigation and 
workers' compensation as a secretary for the Law Offices of Eric Parkan.  A few years later, she progressed 
to the Law Offices of Stanley Sanders and Sandy English as a paralegal, where she engaged in researching and 
drafting contracts and partnership agreements in corporate and business law.  Moving right on up the ladder, 
yet remaining focused, Judge Ephriam became a Certified Law Clerk and performed duties that were second nature 
to her - research, writing and arguing criminal misdemeanor appeals.</p>
  <p>
Taking a break from school, she became a young wife and mother of three. She then decided it was time to enter 
law school.  She enrolled in the night program at Whittier College School of law in Los Angeles earning her 
Juris Doctor Degree in 1978. She participated in Moot Court and her team won second place in statewide Moot 
Court Honors Program.  This was accomplished without neglecting her family and making sure that her children 
kept their school studies up to par.  The completion of law school was just the beginning of an illustrious 
career heightened by countless awards and recognition.</p>
  <p>
Because she is such an unselfish, people-conscientious woman, who is well respected by colleagues and well 
known for her contributions, she has earned such awards as:  1997 Alumni of the Year-Whittier College; 1996 
Zephyr Ramsey Award-Harriet Buhai [bew-high] Center of Family Law; 1996 Spencer Brandeis Award from the 
Family Law Section-Los Angeles Bar Association (she was the youngest recipient and first Black woman); 1996 
Award of Excellence-State Women's Department, Churches of God In Christ 1st Jurisdiction; 1995 Woman of the 
Year-California State Assembly 48th District; 1993 Distinguished Service-Women's Lawyer 
Association of Los Angeles (WLALA); 1990 Outstanding Leadership-Board of Directors, Harriet Buhai Center & 
Outstanding Contribution to Pro Bono Legal Services-Board of Governors, California State Bar Association:  
1985 Outstanding Service-National Association of
University Women and the 1978 Achievement Award-State Youth Department, Churches of God in Christ 1st Jurisdiction.  
If that is not enough, Judge Ephriam has volunteered in numerous organizations and worked many jobs, such as: 
Hearing Examiner-City of L.A. Civil Service Commission; Board of Directors-Union Rescue Mission (first black woman); 
Member of American Bar Association and National Bar Association; Lecturer-Upward Bound Program, CSUBL; 
Motivational Speaker-L.A. City Schools; Co-Founder-Harriet Buhai Center for Family Law which provides free 
legal services for economically disadvantaged persons); Board of Directors-Southern California Women's 
Dept./Retirement Center Committee, Churches of God In Christ - So. Calif. 1st Jurisdiction, Advisor to 
Pastor Ron Hill-Love and Unity Church of God In Christ; member and Past (1982-1983) President of Black 
Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles.</p>
  <p>
In October of 1998, Twentieth Television selected this experienced, distinguished law practitioner and 
mediator to sit as Judge on the newly, revised half hour syndicated show "Divorce Court", where there 
is no script, nor actors, just real cases and real litigants with Judge Ephriam rendering legally-binding 
decisions.  This all came about by God's divine will.  Judge Mablean did not seek the position.  Through 
word-of-mouth regarding her legal talents and referrals from strangers, Fox executives sought Judge Ephriam, 
liked what they saw and the rest is (herstory).  </p>
  <p>
After ending her seven season run on Divorce Court (1999-2006), Judge Ephriam is a much sought after public 
speaker for Women's Conferences, Churches, Community and Civic Organizations, Colleges and Schools, Dealing 
with Relationship Issues and motivating others to pursue their dreams.</p>
   <p>
Additionally, she is working on the mission of her nonprofit foundation, The Mablean Ephriam Foundation,  
to build stronger families, educate minds, increase economic power among disadvantaged and lower economic 
persons and thus create better communities.  She is most thankful for the opportunity to provide day-to-day 
care to her 95 year old mother who is in need of her assistance.</p>
  <p>
This hard-working woman is an entrepreneur. She is the owner of Mablean's Limousine Services; co-owner of 
Jubilane Guest House, a Bed & Breakfast in Johannesburg, South Africa; and founder of an awards program, 
Honoring Unsung Fathers.  </p>
  <p>
Judge Ephriam attributes her success to God, her family and close friends.  Her faith, religion and trust 
in God keep this mother of four and grandmother of nine, meek and humble.</p>

		<h3>Letter From Christine Watson Reed</h3>
		<p>Hello Mablean, <br><br>I hope you remember Me.  My name in school was Christine 
		Watson. </p>

	<p>	I am so glad to have gone to school with you and to say that I know you 
		personally.  I would like to thank you for the times in school (at 
		Jeff) when you would refuse to let me off campus.  You were doing your 
		job, but I was being difficult.  Even at times calling you names. </p>

	<p>	I started working for the City of Los Angeles in 1978.  Shortly after 
		then, I saw you in the hallway.  We were both waiting for the 
		elevator.  I was too embarrassed to speak to you, remembering the times 
		at school when I would call you names, because you were doing your 
		job.  I ended up graduating from Jeff, a year later than I was supposed 
		to.  I can't help but think you had a part in my getting that diploma.  
		The times that you did not let me off campus could have been when I may 
		have gotten in to trouble, and lost my desire to finish school. </p>

	<p>	The next time I saw you I was at the funeral for Patty Mckay's sister 
		and her husband.  Remember their son killed both of them.  At the 
		funeral you got my attention and spoke to me.  When I looked up to see 
		who was calling my name, I was shocked that it was you.  Because I 
		certainly treated you unfairly.  I waved at you, and wanted to wait 
		after the funeral for you, but I had to get back to work.</p> 

		<p>Please accept my heart-felt and most humble apology for the names that 
		I called you.  You have always been such a nice and caring person. I 
		enjoyed watching you on television. </p>

		<p>I retired from the City of Los Angeles in 2006.  I did an early 
		retirement due to my husband and I trying to raise two of our 
		grandchildren with special needs.  Well, I definitely retired too 
		soon.  I am now back trying to secure a job to supplement my retirement 
		income. </p>

	<p>	Mablean, I could tell when I would watch you on TV that you have not 
		changed.  Even when you were on TV you seem to have remained grounded 
		in being concerned for people. </p>

		God bless you,<br>Christine Watson Reed
