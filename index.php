				<p>	My warmest and most cordial greeting is extended to each of you! You have reached the friendly website of the 
					Mablean Ephriam Foundation. I tremendously appreciate every visitor to this site and I do take the time to 
					personally review and reflect on the comments you leave behind. The creation of the Mablean Ephriam 
					Foundation is a real dream-come-true. For years, I have dreamed of putting into action, programs and 
					projects that provide outreach to the underprivileged. My success, as Judge Mablean in the syndicated 
					television show, "Divorce Court", has opened an extraordinary door for a marvelous array of philanthropic work. 
					Currently, I am in serious planning for my Eighth Annual "Honoring Unsung Fathers (H.U.F.) Awards and Scholarship Brunch".
					 This event extends rare honors to everyday fathers, who do a yeomen's job raising, supporting and loving their 
					child(ren). 
					</p>
				<p>	The affair convenes each year on Fathers Day. This year, Father's Day is (June 19, 2011). In the past we have 
					been blessed to experience wonderful moments and fond memories. We expect nothing less than fabulous for 2011. 
					Please click on the link labeled "<a href="http://www.hufawards.com" target="_blank">H.U.F. Awards</a>" for more details.
					 In addition, I invite you to review the wonderful mix of other activities and programs that are currently under 
					development for the Mablean Ephriam Foundation. 
					</p>
				<p>	An invitation and opportunity to contact my Foundation can be easily accessed with a single click on 
					"<a href="contact.php">Contact Us</a>". 
					</p>
					<p>May I hear from you? 
					</p>
					<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit the Mablean Ephriam Foundation. I look forward to hearing from you 
						and, perhaps one day meeting you personally. Remember, “STRONGER FAMILIES, EDUCATED MINDS, ECONOMIC 
						POWER =BETTER COMMUNITIES”. Have a wonderful and prosperous day. 
</p>

				<p>	Warmest Regards, </p>

					<p>Judge Mablean Ephriam, Fox TV "Divorce Court"<br>
					President/Chairman of Board, Mablean Ephriam Foundation<br>
					Founder/Host, Honoring Unsung Fathers (H.U.F.) Scholarship Awards & Brunch</p></div>
